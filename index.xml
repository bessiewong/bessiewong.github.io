      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://bessiewong.github.io/images/pxfuel.com-id-xppht.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Conversation Partners in conversation about language, learning, and SFU.&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/slc/eal/conversation/registration-form-eal-esl-students&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SLC Conversation Partners Program&lt;/a&gt;  pairs EAL students with volunteer peers. Conversation partners then meet on a weekly basis throughout the semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, SLC Peer  &lt;strong&gt;Bessie W.&lt;/strong&gt; interviewed two of her conversation partners, Bin and Dan, to hear their unique perspectives on the program and their experiences at SFU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bin&lt;/strong&gt;  is an Economics student who arrived in Canada three years ago from the Guangdong province of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan&lt;/strong&gt;  is an Interactive Arts and Technology student from the SiChuan province of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What motivated you to participate in the SLC Conversation Partners Program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan:&lt;/strong&gt;  For international students, language is the first challenge, especially for first year students. There is no other way for us to know the cultural differences and having a conversational partner will help us to understand. A lot of the English we learned in high school is not applicable to what we actually say in an English-speaking country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bin:&lt;/strong&gt; I was planning to sign up for co-op next semester and wanted someone to practice my speaking skills with because there will be lots of situations where I will need to speak my opinions, such as during interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your biggest takeaway from the program so far? What did you enjoy the most?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan:&lt;/strong&gt;  Before attending this program, I was not comfortable speaking in discussions and teamwork and I was fearful that they wouldn’t take my opinions seriously. Now, I have the courage to speak out and express myself, especially among English speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bin:&lt;/strong&gt; I was provided with a great opportunity to practice and improve my English speaking skills. My peer was like a mentor to me because she was patient with me, and it was an open space where I could ask questions. We even talked about the past election that occurred!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do you see yourself in five years? Staying in Canada or elsewhere?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan:&lt;/strong&gt;  I hope to graduate and find a job here. My goal is to make a living by myself, with no financial support from my parents. My own mindset has changed a lot after living in Canada, so I might not follow the culture back in China. For example, people doing business in China often talk indirectly when giving feedback or criticism, but I prefer people to be direct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bin:&lt;/strong&gt;  For myself, I would ideally like to work for 2-3 years after graduation and then move back to China. Family is important to me and that is a motivational factor for me. It is where I feel the most at home, where I belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of the struggles of living as an EAL student at SFU/ in Canada?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan:&lt;/strong&gt; During my first year as a Fraser International College student, I couldn’t understand the academic language from the professors. I would question their processes because of the cultural difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bin:&lt;/strong&gt; Academically, listening is hard because we end up falling more behind and have to make up with extra study time in order to fully understand the material. Participation is a big deal in universities in Canada, so we must speak up in order to earn marks, but sometimes we might be judged or critiqued from our lack of English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some things that you would like non-EAL students to know?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan:&lt;/strong&gt; This program is not just for learning and improving the English language, but through language we can learn a lot of people’s ideologies and their thoughts, and how they engage in their ideas. We both learn from each others’ perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bin:&lt;/strong&gt;  Learning a language is a continuous process, it takes time and as much as you learn it, you also need to use it. The most important thing is that you need to find a real interest so that you can practice. Maybe that is watching a TV show or reading a book in that language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you both for sharing your thoughts and experiences!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Bessie W.&lt;/strong&gt; has been an EAL Peer at the Student Learning Commons since 2015. She enjoys learning about various cultures and languages around the world. She is a Communications student with an interest in writing and social media marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
